# Active Noise Control (ANC) in Automotive Cabin

## Overview
A proof-of-concept for Active Noise Control using MATLAB and LabVIEW with real-time sensor integration for in-cabin noise suppression.

## Key Contributions
- Built ANC algorithm to suppress unwanted frequencies.
- Integrated real-time feedback loops using sensors and actuators.
- Documented SOPs and designed part flow simulations.

## Skills & Tools
MATLAB | LabVIEW | Noise & Vibration (NVH) | Manufacturing 4.0

## Outcome
Improved cabin acoustic performance and prototyped a flexible ANC system for testing.
